# Class

A java class is a group of values with a set of operations to manipulate this values.

It is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. It is use to define a new data type(primitive).

## Attributes

Variables and methods used in the class are called attributes/fields. Attributes are accessed by creating an object of the class and dot notation.

**A class contains following members:**

- Instance Variables
- Methods
- Constructor

## Instance Variable

Variable defined within a class are called instance variables because each instance of the class(that is,each object of the class) contains its own copy of these variable.

# Object

It represent an instance of a class. It's a runtime entity that holds the state and behaviour of a class. Object is a class type variable. When you create a class, you are creating a new data type. And you can use this data type by declaring objects of this data type.

Each time you create an object of a class, a copy of each instance variables is created except static varible, its create only once.

Objects are create using the `new` keyword. Each object is stored at a unique memory location.
**Create Object:**

```java
Box myBox; // reference
myBox=new Box(); // allocate
```

## `new` Operator

It is used to create new objects

- allocates memory for the object on the heap
- initializes the object by calling its constructor
- returns a reference to that memory which is used to access the object's methods and attributes.

# Constructor

A class contructor if defined is called whenever a program creates an object of that class. It is invoked directly when an object is created and before new operator execute completely.

It doesn't have any return type, not even void and hence can't return any values. It is used to initialize objects. It is called when an instance of a class is created, and it usually sets initial values for the objects attributes.

It doesn't inherited as it's not part of class member.
**Types:**

1. default constructor
2. parameterized constructor

## Default Constructor

A default constructor is automatically provided by the java compiler if no constructors are explicitly defined in a class. It initializes object fields with default value(null, 0).It has the same access modifier as the class.

## Parameterized Constructor

A parameterized constructor accepts parameters, allowing you to initialize the objects fields with specific values at the time of creation.

## Constructor Chaining

It refers to the process of calling one constructor from another within the same/different class. It is used to reduce code duplication and ensure proper initialization.

Each class calls the constructor of its parent class when it is instantiated, leading to a chain of constructor calls. Constructor doesn't inherited as it's not part of the class member. But in every inheritance constructor of parent class will be called, which result constructor chaining.

```java
class SuperParent{
    SuperParent(){
        System.out.println("I'm Super Parent");
    }
    SuperParent(int x){
        System.out.println("I'm Super Parent with "+x);
    }
}
class Parent extends SuperParent{
    Parent(){
        System.out.println("I'm Parent");
    }
    Parent(int x){
        System.out.println("I'm Parent with "+x);
    }
}
class Child extends Parent{
    Child(){
        System.out.println("I'm Child");
    }
    Child(int x){
        System.out.println("I'm Child with "+x);
    }
}
class SuperChild extends Child{
    SuperChild(){
        super(4);
        System.out.println("I'm SuperChild");
    }
    SuperChild(int x){
        System.out.println("I'm SuperChild with "+x);
    }
}
```

# Method

variables used in method signature are called parameter, and variables used during call are called arguments.

Instance method can call an instance methods directly. There is no need to use object.

## Method Overloading

When more than one method with the same name is defined in the same class,it is known as method overloading as long as their parameter declarations are different.

**Method overloading is a way to achieve `static polymorphism` in java.**

## Method Overriding

The ability of a subclass to re-implement an instance method inherited from a superclass is called method overriding.

- overriding method must have same argument list and return type.
- final, static, constructor method can't be overriden.

**Method overloading is a way to achieve `dynamic polymorphism` in java.**

If a method in a subclass has the same method signature as a method in its superclass, the subclass method overrides the inherited method. If a method in a subclass has the different method signature as a method in its superclass, the subclass method overloads the inherited method.

```java
class SuperParent{
    static void show(double x){
        System.out.println("Super Parent");
    }
}
class Parent extends SuperParent{
    static void show(int x){
        System.out.println("Parent");
    }
}
class Test extends Parent{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        show(4);
        show(4.5);
    }
}
```

## `static`

- variable is declare outside method, constructor or any block
- variable can be used as common property(variable) of all objects of it's class as it's belong to class not object
- don't make multiple copy for multiple object.
- method can't use `this` or `super` keyword.
- method can't use non-static member
- don't need to use class or object name if both are in the same class

**Belongs to the Class:** doen't make multiple instances for multiple object.

```java
class Parent{
    static int x=5;
    void show(){
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Parent p1= new Parent();
        Parent p2= new Parent();
        p1.x=10;
        p2.x=10;
        p1.show();
        p2.show();
    }
}
```

As x belongs to the `Parent` class, any modification to `x` through one instance will affect all instances of the class.

**No Access to Instance Variables or Methods:** Static methods can only access other static methods or static variables of the class. They cannot directly access instance variables or methods because they are not associated with an object (instance) and thus have no knowledge of instance-level data. So, we have to create an instance of the class inside static method to access non-static property.

```java
class Test{
    static int x=5;
    int y=10;
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println(x);
        // System.out.println(y); // on-static variable y cannot be referenced from a static context

        Test t=new Test();
        System.out.println(t.y);
    }
}
```

## `private`

- accessible within the class it is declared
- can't accessible not even in child class
- can't use in class/interface

## `protected`

- accessible anywhere within the same package
- can't use in class/interface

## `default`

- accessible anywhere within the same package

# Keywords

## `final`

- class can't be inherited
- method can't be overriden
- variable can be inherited but can't modifyable
- final instance variable can only be initialized through constructor

## this, super keyword

- anywhere in the program

### this

- differentiate the local scope and class scope.
  **Passing Current Object as Argument:**

```java
class ClassB{
    void show(ClassA a){
        System.out.println(a.x);
    }
}
class ClassA{
    int x = 5;
    ClassB b = new ClassB();
    void show(){
        b.show(this);
    }
}
class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ClassA a = new ClassA();
        a.show();
    }
}
```

**Returning the Current Object:**

```java
class ClassA{
    int x = 5;
    ClassA show(){
        return this;
    }
}
class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ClassA a = new ClassA();
        ClassA s = a.show();
        System.out.println(s.x);
    }
}
```

### super

- refer immediate parent class

## this(), super() method

- only inside constructor
- must be first statement in a constructor.
- can't be use together

### this()

### super()

- invoke immediate parent class constructor

# Interface

It defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It allows for a form of abstraction, enabling the seperation of what a class can do from how it does it.

- It only contain method signature and declaration.
- All methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`
- All fields are implicitly `public`, `static`, `final`
- Can't have constructor, meaning you can't instantiate(object creation) direclty
- One interface can extend another interface, and classes are implment interfaces

# OOP

**Key Concepts of OOP:**

- [Encapsulation](#encapsulation)
- [Inheritance](#inheritance)
- [Polymorphism](#polymorphism)
- [Abstraction](#abstraction)

## Encapsulation

It involves bundling member of class into a single unit. It also invloves restricting access to some of the objects components, which is achieved by using access modifier like `private`, `protected`, `public`. The key idea is keep the internal represention of an object hidden from outside world.

```java
class BankAccount{
    private String accountNumber;
    BankAccount(String accountNumber){
        this.accountNumber=accountNumber;
    }
    public getAccountNumber(){ return accountNumber; }
}
```

- `accountNumber` cannot be accessed directly from outside the `BankAccount` class.
- `getAccountNumber()` methods provides read-only access to the `accountNumber`, ensuring that it cannot be changed from outside the class.

## Inheritance

It allow child class to inherit properties from parent class

- Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through classes but supports it through interfaces.
- Sub-class can override method defined in parent class.

**Types:**

1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance - chain of class
3. Hierarchical Inheritance - multiple classes inherited from a single parent class
4. Multiple Inheritance - single child class inherited from multiple parent class(not supported through classes)

### Multiple Inheritance

```java
interface CanFly{
    void fly();
}

interface CanSwim{
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements CanFly, CanSwim{
    public void fly(){ System.out.println("Duck can fly"); }
    public void swim(){ System.out.println("Duck can swim"); }
    public void sound(){ System.out.println("I'm Duck"); }
}
```

**Wrong way:**

```java
class CanFly{
    public void fly(){ System.out.println("Duck can fly"); }
}

class CanSwim{
    public void swim(){ System.out.println("Duck can swim"); }
}

class Duck extends CanFly, CanSwim{
    public void sound(){ System.out.println("I'm Duck"); }
}
```

## Polymorphism

It refers to the ability of a single interface to represent different underlying forms(data types). It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.

**Types of polymorphism:**

- Static/Compile-Time Polymorphism
- Dynamic/Run-Time Polymorphism

### Static(Overloading)

Define in compilation time.

```java
class Calculator{
    public int add(int a, int b){ return a+b; }
    public int add(int a, int b, int c){ return a+b+c; }
    public int add(int a, int b, int c, int d){ return a+b+c+d; }
}

public static void main(String[] args){
    Calculator calc=new Calculator();
    System.out.println(calc.add(10,20));
    System.out.println(calc.add(10,20,30));
    System.out.println(calc.add(10,20,30,40));
}
```

### Dynamic(Overriding)

Effect are shown in run-time.

```java
class Animal{
    public void sound(){
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal{
    @Override
    public void sound(){
        System.out.println("Dog makes a sound");
    }
}
class Cat extends Animal{
    @Override
    public void sound(){
        System.out.println("Dog makes a sound");
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args){
    Animal animal=new Animal();
    Dog dog=new Dog();
    Cat cat=new Cat();

    animal.sound();
    dog.sound();
    cat.sound();
}
```

## Abstraction

It focuses on `hiding the internal implementation` of a class and exposing only the essential features to the outside world. It can't instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. Abstraction is primarilly achieved using `abstract` classes and `interface`s.

### `abstract` classes

- can have both abstract & concrete method.
- can have instance variable
- can have constructor
- object can't be created

```java
abstract class Shape{
    abstract void draw();
    void display(){ System.out.println("This is a shape"); }
}
class Circle extends Shape{
    void draw(){ System.out.println("Drawing a circle"); }
}
```

### `interface`

- only have abstract method
- only `final` and static variable
- can't have constructor
- multiple inheritance is possible
- implemented class must define all the methods declared in the interface

```java
interface Shape{
    void draw();
}
class Circle implements Shape{
    public void draw(){ System.out.println("Drawing a circle"); }
    public void display(){ System.out.println("This is a shape"); }
}
```

# String

- `next()` stops reading at whitespace and returns only a single token.
- `nextLine()` reads the entire line until a newline, capturing everything entered, including spaces.

If you use `next()` before `nextLine()`, the newline character left in the input buffer by `next()` will cause `nextLine()` to read it as an empty line. To handle this, you may need an extra `nextLine()` to consume the newline left after `next()`.

## String

The `String` class in Java represents an immutable sequence of characters. Immutable means once a `String` object is created, it cannot be changed. It's a sequence of characters but not a character array.

## StringBuffer

`StringBuffer` is a mutable sequence of characters. Unlike `String`, `StringBuffer` allows modifications without creating new objects. It’s synchronized, meaning thread-safe (safe to use in multithreaded contexts).

### Common Methods

- `append(String str)`: Adds the given string to the end of the existing string.
- `insert(int offset, String str)`: Inserts a string at the specified position.
- `replace(int start, int end, String str)`: Replaces characters between the start and end positions with the given string.
- `delete(int start, int end)`: Deletes characters from start to end positions.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the string.

### Example

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        sb.append(" World");
        sb.replace(6, 11, "Earth");
        System.out.println("StringBuffer Output: " + sb);
    }
}
```

## StringBuilder

`StringBuilder` is also a mutable sequence of characters, similar to `StringBuffer`, but it’s not synchronized (not thread-safe)

## String Constructor

The `String` class provides multiple constructors that allow you to create `String` objects from various data types and sources.

### Types of `String` Constructor

1. **Default constructor:**

   - `String()`: Creates an empty string `""`.

2. **String from another string:**

   - `String(String str)`: Creates a new string that is a copy of the argument str.

3. **String from a character array:**

   - `String(char[] value)`: Converts a character array to a string.

4. **String from a part of a character array:**

   - `String(char[] value, int offset, int count)`: Creates a string from a subset of a character array.

5. **String from a byte array:**

   - `String(byte[] bytes)`: Converts a byte array to a string.

### Example

```java
public class StringConstructorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Default constructor (empty string)
        String str1 = new String();
        System.out.println("str1: \"" + str1 + "\"");

        // String from another string
        String str2 = new String("Hello");
        System.out.println("str2: " + str2);

        // String from a character array
        char[] charArray = {'J', 'a', 'v', 'a'};
        String str3 = new String(charArray);
        System.out.println("str3: " + str3);

        // String from a part of a character array
        String str4 = new String(charArray, 1, 2);
        System.out.println("str4: " + str4);

        // String from a byte array
        byte[] byteArray = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111};  // ASCII codes for 'Hello'
        String str5 = new String(byteArray);
        System.out.println("str5: " + str5);
    }
}
```

# Exceptions

An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It is an object that represents an error or an unexpected situation that occurs during the execution of a program.

**Why exception occurs:**

- User error
- Programmer error
- Resources error

## Exception Hierarchy

The Exception Hierarchy in Java is structured under the Throwable class, which is the superclass for all errors and exceptions. This hierarchy helps developers understand how different types of errors and exceptions are related and how they can be handled in Java applications.

The Throwable class has two main subclasses.

### Error

Errors in Java represent serious problems that an application should not attempt to catch or handle. They are typically external to the application and represent critical problems, such as hardware failures or JVM issues. Errors are generally not recoverable.

**Examples:**

- `OutOfMemoryError`: Occurs when the JVM runs out of memory.
- `StackOverflowError`: Occurs when the application recurses too deeply, causing the call stack to overflow.

### Exception

Exceptions represent conditions that a typical application can recover from.

#### Types of Exceptions

##### Checked Exceptions

Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The Java compiler ensures that these exceptions are either handled using a `try-catch` block or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. If a method can throw a checked exception, it must be handled explicitly in the code, otherwise, the program will not compile.

These exceptions typically represent scenarios that are out of the program's control but can be expected, such as reading from a file or database access issues.

**Common Examples of Checked Exceptions:**

- `IOException`
- `SQLException`
- `ClassNotFoundException`
- `FileNotFoundException`

**Example:**

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Trying to open a file that may not exist
            File file = new File("non_existent_file.txt");
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            // Handling the FileNotFoundException
            System.out.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

##### Unchecked exceptions

Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. These exceptions occur at runtime and are not required to be explicitly handled or declared. Unchecked exceptions are typically caused by programming errors or unforeseen conditions, such as dividing by zero or accessing an array element out of bounds.

Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of `RuntimeException` and typically represent logic errors in the program that could have been avoided through better coding practices.

**Common Examples of Unchecked Exceptions:**

- `NullPointerException`
- `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
- `ArithmeticException`
- `IllegalArgumentException`

**Example:**

```java
public class UncheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 10;
        int num2 = 0;

        // No try-catch block needed
        int result = num1 / num2;  // Will throw ArithmeticException at runtime

        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

##### Key Differences

| Checked Exceptions                                                                        | Unchecked Exceptions                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Checked at compile-time.                                                                  | Checked at runtime.                                                            |
| Must be handled using `try-catch` or declared with `throws`.                              | Handling is optional, though recommended.                                      |
| Inherits from `Exception` but not from `RuntimeException`.                                | Inherits from `RuntimeException`.                                              |
| Represents conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and recover from. | Represents programming errors or runtime issues that are harder to anticipate. |
| Examples: `IOException`, `SQLException`.                                                  | Examples: `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`.                       |

## Handling Exceptions

- `try`: A block of code that might throw an exception.
- `catch`: A block of code that handles the exception.
- `finally`: A block of code that executes after the `try-catch` block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown.
- `throw`: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
- `throws`: Used in method signatures to indicate that a method might throw an exception.

# Multitasking

Multitasking is the capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously. In Java, multitasking can be achieved using two main approaches:

1. [Process-based multitasking (Heavyweight)](#process-based-multitasking)
2. Thread-based multitasking (Lightweight)

## Process-based Multitasking

- Each process has its own memory space.
- Processes do not share memory space with each other.
- Each task is a seperate independent program(process).
- Switching between processes is more expensive because the operating system must save the state of one process and load the state of another.
- Java doesn't directly support process-based multitasking but it can create new processes using classes like `ProcessBuilder` or `Runtime`.

**Example:** Running external programs like opening a file using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.

## Thread-based Multitasking

- A thread is a lightweight sub-process and is the smallest unit of a program that can execute independently.
- All threads of a process share the same memory space.
- Each task is a seperate independent part of same program
- Switching between threads is more efficient compared to processes.
- Java provides built-in support for threads through:
  - `java.lang.Thread` class
  - `java.lang.Runnable` interface
    This is the most common form of multitasking in Java, and it is what we generally mean when we refer to multitasking in Java.

# Thread

## Main Thread

It is the initial thread that starts when a Java program begins its execution. It is created by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to start running the main() method of a program.

It serves as the entry point for all Java programs and controls the life cycle of other threads if they are created within the main() method.

### Characteristics of the Main Thread

- **Automatically Created:** The JVM automatically creates the main thread when the program starts.
- **Entry Point:** It is the entry point of every Java application, starting with the `main()` method.
- **Thread Name:** By default, the name of the main thread is `main`.
- **Default Priority:** The main thread has a default priority of `5` (normal priority).
- **Control Over Other Threads:** The main thread can create, start, and manage other threads. It continues to run until either the `main()` method completes or the JVM is instructed to exit.
- **Execution Order:** Even though the main thread is the first to start, it does not necessarily finish first, especially if it creates other threads that continue running. The order in which threads finish depends on their tasks and execution.

**Examplee:**

```java
public class Man {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Getting a reference to the main thread
        Thread mainThread = Thread.currentThread();
        System.out.println("Main thread name: " + mainThread.getName());
        System.out.println("Main thread priority: " + mainThread.getPriority());
        System.out.println("Is main thread alive? " + mainThread.isAlive());

        // Setting the name of the main thread
        mainThread.setName("PrimaryThread");
        System.out.println("Renamed main thread: " + mainThread.getName());

        System.out.println("Main thread is ending.");
    }
}
```

## Creation

There are two ways to create threads in Java:

1. Extending the `Thread` class
2. Implementing the `Runnable` interface

### Extending `Thread`

- This approach involves creating a subclass of the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.
- The `run()` method contains the code that defines the task that the thread will execute.

**Example:**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code that the thread will execute
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " is running: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(); // Create first thread
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(); // Create second thread

        t1.start(); // Start the first thread
        t2.start(); // Start the second thread
    }
}
```

### Implementing `Runnable`

- This approach involves creating a class that implements the `Runnable` interface and defining the `run()` method.
- It allows more flexibility because your class does not need to extend `Thread` (which is beneficial when you want to extend another class).

**Example:**

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Code that the thread will execute
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " is running: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(myRunnable); // Create first thread
        Thread t2 = new Thread(myRunnable); // Create second thread

        t1.start(); // Start the first thread
        t2.start(); // Start the second thread
    }
}
```

## LifeCycle

- **New:** Thread object is created but `start()` is not yet called.
- **Runnable:** After `start()`, the thread is ready to run but might not be running if the CPU is busy.
- **Running:** The thread is executing its `run()` method.
- **Blocked/Waiting:** The thread is paused, waiting for a resource or a condition to become true.
- **Terminated:** The thread finishes execution or is stopped.

## Methods

### Creation and Control

- `start()` - Starts a new thread by calling its `run()` method. It transitions the thread from the new state to the runnable state.
- `run()` - Contains the code that is executed by the thread. This method should be overridden, overloading doesn't work here. Directly calling `t1.run()` method consider as normal method of Thread class.
- `yield()` - Suggests to the JVM that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of a processor. It makes the currently running thread move to the runnable state to allow other threads of the same priority to execute.
- `sleep(long millis)` - Causes the current thread to sleep (pause execution) for the specified number of milliseconds.
- `join()` - Waits for the thread on which this method is called to die (finish execution). This can be used to ensure that a thread completes before the execution of another thread continues.
  - Overloads:
    - `join()` - Waits indefinitely.
    - `join(long millis)` - Waits for the specified milliseconds.
    - `join(long millis, int nanos)` - Waits for the specified time in milliseconds and nanoseconds.

### Status and Information

- `isAlive()` - Returns true if the thread is still alive (has been started and has not yet terminated).
- `isInterrupted()` - Returns true if the thread has been interrupted. It does not clear the interrupted status of the thread.
- `getId()` - Returns the unique ID of the thread.
- `getName() / setName(String name)` - Gets or change the name of the thread.
- `getPriority() / setPriority(int newPriority)` - Gets or sets the priority of the thread (values between `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1) and `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10)). The default is `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5).
- `getState()` - Returns the current state of the thread as an instance of `Thread.State` enum (e.g., `NEW`, `RUNNABLE`, `BLOCKED`, `WAITING`, `TIMED_WAITING`, `TERMINATED`).getId():
  Returns the unique ID of the thread.

### Thread Management

- `currentThread()` (Static method) - Returns a reference to the currently executing thread object.

# I/O Streams

I/O (Input/Output) streams are used to read and write data from various sources, such as files, network connections, or even the console.

## Types

1. **Character Streams**: Handle data in characters, ideal for text data. These streams are capable of handling Unicode characters.
   - [File](#file)
   - [FileReader](#filereader)
   - [BufferedReader](#bufferedreader)
   - [FileWriter](#filewriter)
   - [BufferedWriter](#bufferedwriter)
2. **Byte Streams**: Handle data in bytes, which is suitable for handling binary data like images or audio files. These streams read and write data one byte at a time.
   - [FileInputStream](#fileinputstream)
   - [FileOutputStream](#fileoutputstream)

### `File`

It represents both file and directory pathnames in an abstract manner. It allows us to create, delete, and manipulate files and directories, as well as check file properties.

#### Common Methods

1. `exists()`: Checks if a file or directory exists.
2. `createNewFile()`: Creates a new file if it does not exist.
3. `delete()`: Deletes a file or directory.
4. `mkdir()` and `mkdirs()`: Creates a single or multiple directories.
5. `getName()`: Returns the name of the file or directory.
6. `getAbsolutePath()`: Returns the absolute path of the file.
7. `length()`: Returns the size of the file in bytes.
8. `canRead()`, `canWrite()`, `canExecute()`: Checks if the file is readable, writable, or executable.
9. `isFile()` and `isDirectory()`: Checks if the `File` object represents a file or a directory.
10. `list()` and `listFiles()`: Lists files and directories inside a director

#### Example

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a File object for a new file
        File file = new File("example.txt");

        // Step 2: Create the file if it doesn't exist
        try {
            if (file.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created: " + file.getName());
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while creating the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Step 3: Display file properties
        System.out.println("File name: " + file.getName());
        System.out.println("Absolute path: " + file.getAbsolutePath());
        System.out.println("Is writable: " + file.canWrite());
        System.out.println("Is readable: " + file.canRead());
        System.out.println("Is executable: " + file.canExecute());
        System.out.println("Is a file: " + file.isFile());
        System.out.println("Is a directory: " + file.isDirectory());
        System.out.println("File size (bytes): " + file.length());

        // Step 4: Create a directory
        File directory = new File("sampleDirectory");
        if (directory.mkdir()) {
            System.out.println("Directory created: " + directory.getName());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Directory already exists.");
        }

        // Step 5: List files in the directory (if there are any)
        System.out.println("Files in the directory:");
        File[] files = directory.listFiles();
        if (files != null && files.length > 0) {
            for (File f : files) {
                System.out.println(" - " + f.getName());
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("No files found in the directory.");
        }

        // Step 6: Delete the file
        if (file.delete()) {
            System.out.println("File deleted: " + file.getName());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
        }

        // Step 7: Delete the directory
        if (directory.delete()) {
            System.out.println("Directory deleted: " + directory.getName());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to delete the directory. It may not be empty.");
        }
    }
}
```

### `FileReader`

It is used to read the contents of a file as a stream of characters. It is designed for reading character files and is typically used for reading text data.

#### Common Methods

1. `read()` - Reads a single character from the file.
2. `close()` - Closes the file reader and releases any system resources associated with it.
3. `ready()` - Tells whether the input stream is ready to be read.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the file name to read
        String fileName = "example.txt";

        // Using try-with-resources to ensure the file is closed automatically
        try (FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(fileName);
             BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader)) {

            String line;
            // Read the file line by line
            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line); // Print each line to the console
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### `BufferedReader`

It is used for reading text from an input stream (like a file). It buffers the input, which means it reads large chunks of data at once and keeps it in memory, reducing the number of reads required directly from the underlying source.

#### Common Methods

- `read()` - Reads a single character or an array of characters.
- `readLine()` - Reads a line of text, returning null when the end of the stream is reached.
- `close()` - Closes the BufferedReader and releases any associated resources.
- `ready()` - Checks if the BufferedReader is ready to be read from without blocking.
- `skip(long n)` - Skips n characters from the input.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a BufferedReader object
        try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"))) {

            // Step 2: Read the file line by line
            String line;
            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while reading the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### `FileWriter`

It is used to write character-based data to a file.

#### Common Methods

- `write(String str)`: Writes the entire string to the file.
- `write(char[] cbuf)`: Writes a character array to the file.
- `close()`: Closes the file writer and releases any system resources associated with the file.
- `flush()`: Ensures that any buffered data is written to the file.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String data = "Hello, this is a test of FileWriter in Java!";

        // Try-with-resources ensures the FileWriter is closed automatically
        try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
            // Writing string data to the file
            fileWriter.write(data);
            System.out.println("Data has been written to the file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### `BufferedWriter`

It is used to write text to a character output stream (like a file) in an efficient way. It buffers the output, meaning it collects characters in memory before writing them to the output stream.

#### Common Methods

- `write(int c)` - Writes a single character.
- `write(char[] cbuf)` - Writes an array of characters.
- `write(String s)` - Writes a string.
- `newLine()` - Writes a line separator (new line).
- `flush()` - Flushes the buffered output to the file, forcing any buffered characters to be written.
- `close()` - Closes the BufferedWriter and releases any associated resources.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a BufferedWriter object
        try (BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {

            // Step 2: Write data to the file
            bufferedWriter.write("Hello, World!");
            bufferedWriter.newLine();  // Writes a newline
            bufferedWriter.write("Welcome to the BufferedWriter example.");
            bufferedWriter.newLine();
            bufferedWriter.write("This is the third line of text.");

            // Step 3: Flush the writer (optional, as try-with-resources handles it)
            bufferedWriter.flush();

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while writing to the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### `FileInputStream`

It is used for reading raw byte data from a file. It is particularly useful for reading binary data, such as images, audio files, or any type of file that isn't purely text. Since it reads bytes directly, it is not the best choice for reading character data like plain text files.

#### Common Methods

- `int read()` - Reads a single byte of data and returns it as an integer (0-255) or -1 if the end of the file is reached.
- `int read(byte[] b)` - Reads up to b.length bytes of data into the specified byte array.
- `int available()` - Returns the number of remaining bytes that can be read from the stream.
- `void close()` - Closes the input stream and releases any associated system resources.
- `long skip(long n)` - Skips over and discards n bytes of data from the input stream.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileInputStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a FileInputStream object
        try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("input.txt")) {

            // Step 2: Read data from the file
            int byteData;
            while ((byteData = fileInputStream.read()) != -1) {
                // Step 3: Print the read byte data as characters
                System.out.print((char) byteData);
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while reading the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### `FileOutputStream`

It is used for writing raw byte data to a file. It is often used for writing binary data like images, audio files, or serialized objects.

#### Common Methods

- `void write(int b)` - Writes a single byte to the file.
- `void write(byte[] b)` - Writes a byte array to the file.
- `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)` - Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at off to the file.
- `void close()` - Closes the output stream and releases any associated system resources.
- `void flush()` - Flushes the output stream, ensuring that all data is written to the file.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileOutputStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a FileOutputStream object
        try (FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt")) {

            // Step 2: Convert string data to byte array
            String data = "Hello, World!";
            byte[] byteData = data.getBytes();

            // Step 3: Write byte array to the file
            fileOutputStream.write(byteData);

            System.out.println("Data has been written to the file successfully.");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while writing to the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

# Memory Management

## Stack

The stack is a region of memory that stores temporary variables created by each function (method) as it executes. Each thread in a JVM has its own stack, which contains frames. A frame is created whenever a method is called and contains the method's local variables, operand stack, and references to other objects in the heap.

**Characteristics of Stack Memory**:

- **Thread-specific**: Each thread has its own stack memory, isolated from others.
- **Memory allocation and deallocation are automatic**: Memory for variables in the stack is allocated when a method is called and released when the method completes.
- **LIFO** (Last-In-First-Out): Stack follows the LIFO order, meaning the last frame pushed onto the stack is the first one removed.
- **Stores**:
  - Local variables
  - Method calls
  - Primitive values (like `int`, `float`, etc.)
  - References to objects in the heap

## Heap

The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. All objects and their corresponding instance variables are stored in the heap. Unlike stack memory, which is thread-specific, the heap is shared among all threads within the application.

**Characteristics of Heap Memory**:

- **Shared among all threads**: Any object created is accessible to any thread (with proper synchronization).
- **Used for dynamic memory allocation**: Objects created using `new` are stored here.
- **Garbage collection**: Unused or unreferenced objects in the heap are automatically deallocated by the JVM’s garbage collector.
- **Stores**:
  - Objects
  - Instance variables
  - Arrays

## Key Differences

| Feature               | Stack                                        | Heap                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Allocation** | Static or Fixed during execution             | Dynamic, based on runtime requirements |
| **Thread Safety**     | Thread-specific (No concurrency issues)      | Shared (Needs synchronization)         |
| **Storage Contents**  | Local variables, references to objects       | Objects, instance variables            |
| **Access Speed**      | Faster access due to small, fixed size       | Slower due to large, dynamic size      |
| **Lifetime**          | Exists only for the duration of method calls | Exists as long as the object is in use |
| **Management**        | Managed by stack frames (automatic)          | Managed by garbage collection          |
