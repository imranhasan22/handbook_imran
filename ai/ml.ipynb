    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",

    "Machine learning relies on data and algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Data__: Data is the backbone of ML. It can be numerical data, text, images, audio, etc. The more data a model has, the better it can learn the underlying patterns.\n",
    "- __Algorithms__: These are the mathematical or statistical methods that process the data, find patterns, and make predictions. Different types of algorithms are used depending on the problem and the nature of the data."

    "# Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine learning is generally classified into three main categories:\n",
    "1. __Supervised Learning__: Algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the training `data has input-output pairs`. The model learns the relationship between inputs (features) and outputs (labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Unsupervised Learning__: Algorithm is given data without labeled responses. It tries to `learn the underlying structure from the data`, often by grouping similar data points or discovering patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Reinforcement Learning__: An agent learns to `interact with an environment` by performing actions and `receiving rewards or penalties`. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time."

    "- __Training Data__: A dataset used to train the model.\n",
    "- __Testing Data__: A separate dataset used to evaluate the model's performance after training. It checks how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n",
    "- __Model Evaluation Metrics:__\n",
    "    Common metrics to evaluate model performance include:\n",
    "    - __*Accuracy*__: The percentage of correct predictions (used for classification).\n",
    "    - __*Precision and Recall*__: Precision measures the proportion of positive identifications that are actually correct, while recall measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.\n",
    "    - __*Mean Squared Error (MSE)*__: A metric for regression tasks that measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "- __Overfitting__: When a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new data. Itâ€™s like memorizing rather than learning.\n",
    "- __Underfitting__: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and testing data."
