    "- __Data__: Data is the backbone of ML. It can be numerical data, text, images, audio, etc. The more data a model has, the better it can learn the underlying patterns.\n",
    "    - __Continous Data__: Continuous data can take any value within a given range. It can include fractions and decimals, allowing for infinitely many possible values.\n",
    "        - not countable, measureable\n",

    "\n",
    "    For linear regression both input and output variable are continous, for logistic regressoin input variable can be both discreate and continous but output variable always be discrete.\n",

    "2. __Unsupervised Learning__: Algorithm is given data without labeled responses. It tries to `learn the underlying structure from the data`, often by grouping similar data points or discovering patterns.\n",
