# Class
A java class is a group of values with a set of operations to manipulate this values.

It is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. It is use to define a new data type(primitive).

## Attributes
Variables and methods used in the class are called attributes/fields. Attributes are accessed by creating an object of the class and dot notation.

__A class contains following members:__
- Instance Variables
